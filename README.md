# CPTS528-MLAdversary-Project
This is the project repository for CPTS528 Project.

## Overview
This is a project for **CPTS 428/528: Software Security and Reverse Engineering** course.  
The goal of this project is to explore the vulnerability of machine learning models to adversarial attacks and to study methods that can improve adversarial robustness.

## Project Objectives
1. Demonstrate how adversarial examples can affect image classifiers (especially CIFAR-10 in this project).
2. Analyze the performance degradation caused by different attacks.
3. Implement and evaluate defenses to increase robustness against adversarial perturbations.
